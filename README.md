# Dice Football Game

A digital version of the classic dice football board game, built with React and Vite.

## Claude Code Experiment

This game was created as an AI experiment.

1. I took pictures of a wooden board game in a store.
2. I fed the pictures into ChatGPT to build a complete understanding of the game
   from the pictures. I asked it to write out this understanding, as well as its
   proposed implementation overview to a markdown file.
3. I fed this markdown file into Claude Code and asked it to review the game
   and the proposed implementation overview and come up with its own plan for
   how to implement it. I asked it to implement its plan.

After the first implementation, I issued a few follow-up prompts for one major
bug and to improve some layout:

1. Major bug: explain that when posession of the ball changes, the direction of
   play changes. Its first implementation had play continuing in the same
   direction.
2. Adjust layout so that more was visible on the screen at once. (Only tested on
   desktop.)
3. Ask it to add visual indication of who currently has the ball other than the
   info in the game log.
